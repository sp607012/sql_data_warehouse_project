🎯 Project Objectives
🔹 Data Engineering (Data Warehouse)

Build a modern data warehouse using PostgreSQL to consolidate and transform sales data for analytical reporting and decision-making.

Key Requirements:

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP & CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve inconsistencies before analysis.

Integration: Merge ERP & CRM into a unified, user-friendly data model optimized for analytics.

Scope: Focus only on the latest dataset (no historization).

Documentation: Provide clear data model documentation for both business stakeholders and analysts.

📊 Data Analytics (BI Layer)

Develop SQL-based analytics to provide actionable insights.

Focus Areas:

Customer Behavior Analysis

Product Performance

Sales Trends & KPIs

These insights empower stakeholders with strategic metrics for data-driven decision-making.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Database: PostgreSQL 15+

ETL: PL/pgSQL (stored procedures, transformations)

Modeling: Star Schema (Fact & Dimension tables)

Data Layers: Bronze (raw) → Silver (cleansed) → Gold (analytics-ready)

Visualization: SQL queries + optional BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)

✅ Key Features

Automated ETL workflows with error handling

Standardized country codes, gender, dates, and IDs

Row counts & transformation logs for monitoring

Optimized queries with indexes for faster analytics

Scalable star-schema design for reporting
