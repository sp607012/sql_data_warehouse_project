# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository**! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
**Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

#### Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
